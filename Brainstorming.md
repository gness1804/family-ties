##Brainstorming

*Concerns with self-directed project:* 

* I might not be able to have the best "strategic" project for the job market 
* I might get too caught up shaving the yak and lose the big picture 
* I might get lost with the lack of external direction/it might be harder to track my progress

Step One: Ask what problem I want to solve. 

Problem: the problem is that families need a better way to manage their affairs outside of the big platforms like Facebook. 

History: there are platforms like Facebook, Gmail, and Google Calendar, but these can be too bloated and not integrated enough. I am envisioning a cohesive family management application that delivers info that families need to stay connected, but without all the "noise" of the bigger platforms. 

I envision the app having the following core components: 

Components for Turing project: 

Display agenda view for Google Calendar(with curfew times)
Store family videos and photos in one place
Keep info such as height of kids, first tooth loss, etc
Family meeting agendas and notes 
Info on relatives (bio cards) (possibly family tree)

Stuff to do later: 

Family trip/vacation planning
Integration with theme parks, restaurants, etc
Parental access controls (kids can only change certain data such as their input in family meeting notes)
Estate planning tools too
Maybe integration with CaptainU for sports
Google Maps integration for data on family history, vacation and family reunion planning, etc
Google Contacts integration
Eventually have ads from many companies targeting families

Target audience: families, esp families with young children. 

The improv helped because it was liberating; I didn't feel a worry about rejection or that this idea wouldn't work. I think that a close-knit environment is important for creativity, and I am fortunate to have that here. But in an environment without such established relationships, creativity can be fostered by openness to new ideas and positive energy. I could work to create such an environment by thinking innovatively, taking on risks, and being outgoing and dynamic in my way.
